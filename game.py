game.py – Connect 4 logic used for ML training with minimax-labelled data.

This module defines the Connect4 class and provides the game logic used by
the `generate_minimax_dataset.ipynb` and `train_minimax_model.ipynb` notebooks.

Includes:
- Board representation and move handling
- Evaluation function for minimax
- Minimax agent with alpha-beta pruning
- Random, Smart, and ML-based agent methods

Not intended for gameplay; used as a backend logic module for training purposes only.
